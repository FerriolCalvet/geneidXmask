# GeneidX with masking step

In this repository we provide a pipeline for the annotation of any genome starting from any raw genome assembly.

The two main steps are an initial genome masking step that was adapted from the nf-core/genomeannotator pipeline, and then a gene prediction step using [GeneidX](https://github.com/guigolab/geneidx).

We provide a fast and accurate prediction of the protein-coding genes in a genome, taking as input the genome assembly and a set of proteins from closely related species.

This repository contains the implementation of the GeneidX *ab initio* gene prediction method.

In the description here, you can find our preliminary results, a schema of our method and a description of the minimal requirements and commands required for running it.

Stay tuned for an article with detailed descriptions and feel free to [contact us](mailto:ferriol.calvet@crg.eu) if you are trying it and find any problem.


## Preliminary results
 The results of an initial benchmarking using vertebrates genomes annotated in Ensembl show that our method is **as accurate as the top *ab initio* gene predictors**, but it is **between 10 and 100 times faster**.

## Running GeneidX
Having defined the parameters and ensuring that Nextflow and a container technology.

`nextflow run guigolab/geneidx -with-docker
                            --genome <GENOME>
                            --taxid <TAXID>`


## Before running GeneidX
1. **Make sure ( Docker or Singularity ) and Nextflow are installed in your computer.**
  - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
  - [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/installation.html#)
  - [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html#installation)

2. Define the input parameters:
  - Compressed FASTA file with `.fa.gz` termination.
  - Taxid of the species to annotate or from the closest relative described.
  - Proteins from closely related species: (choose one of these options)
      - Provide a compressed FASTA file with the proteins selected.
      - Let the pipeline download the proteins automatically from UniRef90 (nothing should be provided in this case.)
  - Tune parameters for the gene prediction process.
      - Indicate the values for each Geneid parameter.
      - Let the pipeline select them from the closest pretrained Geneid parameter file. (find the parameters in data/Parameter_files.taxid/)
      - Find more information here: [GENEID parameter files](https://genome.crg.es/software/geneid/index.html#parameters)



## Schema
Which steps are taking place as part of this pipeline?
This is a graphical summary, and the specific steps are outlined below.
![Summary of vertebrate benchmark](images/SchemaWhite.png)
1. Get the set of proteins to be used for the protein-to-genome alignments.
2. Get the closest Geneid parameter file to use as source of the parameters not indicated by the user.
3. Create the protein database for DIAMOND to use it as a source.
4. Align the provided genome against the database created using DIAMOND BLASTx flavour.
5. Run the auto-training process:
  - Use matches to estimate the coding sections, look for open reading frames between stop codons.
  - Use matches from the same protein to predict the potential introns.
  - From the sequences of both previous steps compute the initial and transition probability matrices required for the computation of the coding potential of the genome that will be annotated.
6. Update the parameter file with the parameters indicated in the *params.config* file and also the matrices automatically generated from the protein-DNA matches.
7. Run Geneid with the new parameter file and the protein-DNA matches from the previous steps as additional evidence.
This is done in parallel for each independent sequence inside the genome FASTA file, and it consists of the following steps:
  - Pre-process the matches to join those that overlap and re-score them appropriately.
  - Run Geneid using the evidence and obtain the GFF3 file.
  - Remove the files from the internal steps.
8. Concatenate all the outputs into a single GFF3 file that is sorted by coordinates.
9. Add information from proteins matching the predicted genes.


## DETAILS:
- **The name of the sequences in the FASTA file cannot contain unusual characters.**
- **The input genome file must be a gzip-compressed FASTA file. (.fa.gz)**
- **Auto-train the parameter file always.**


## DOING:
-  Optimization of the auto-training additional parameters missing.


## PENDING:
- Tune DIAMOND parameters to make the most of the resources available and to adapt to the capacity of each computer.
- DIAMOND now uses a lot of RAM memory, we have to adjust the execution to reduce the amount of resources used. This may cause an increase in the execution time.
